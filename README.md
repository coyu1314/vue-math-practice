This is a simple math questions generator for kids(G1-G5) who needs to practices match questions. 
If you are a parent like me who is looking for some math practices questions for the kids. This is it. 

This projects including the following:
- Additions
- Subtractions
- Multiplication
- Divisions

You are able to select a range of numbers to generate the questions from. 
All questions will be shuffled automatically. Once the kids finish all the 
questions, they can click on the check answer to see if they get everything correct. 
If you don't like the default range, just modify it to any numbers you wish for you kids.
